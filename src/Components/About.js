                Leasr started in 2019 when a group of students 
                at Santa Clara University decided it was time 
                to create a better alternative to Facebook in 
                order to find a subleaser for their short term 
                room rentals. Spam messages, lack of organization, 
                no rental location, no easily accessible searching filters, 
                and a lack of serious inquiries inspired us to create 
                this website and we hope it helps you in your search to 
                find a subleaser or rent a room. If you enjoy your experience 
                with the website please share it with others and help us 
                because the top resource for subleasing in the Santa Clara 
                University Area! We are passionate about consistently 
                improving the website and making your subleasing 
                experience as smooth as possible.
